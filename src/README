shutterfly.py is the main script that will utilize functions define in functions.py.

Future work might include:

    1. Read datasource from multiple files both in number and formats(not only txt files), and be able to combine results, or maybe connect to database directly.
    2. Split JSON files into multiple small chunks(to solve memory limit issue). 
    3. Create and organize error log (right now only show error message in the console, this can help track problematic event data and can further improve data source validation).
